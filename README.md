# Swell
## About the Project
Swell is a communcication platform that allows users to connect with their friends and family. Users create groups known as *Envelopes,* which contain custom questions for members to fill out. Once completed, members will recieve a published version of the Envelope in their inbox!

## As a user, you may...
- Register, login, and logout of the app
- Create Envelope groups with personalized questions
- Send custom invite links to friends via email
- Answer questions created by the admin/users
- Receive periodic emails containing Envelope updates with [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html)
